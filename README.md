## 🧠 AI & Machine Learning Projects

### 🔹 Automated Detection of Visual Pollution Using Drones
- **Description**:  
  This project focuses on detecting and classifying visual pollution (e.g., garbage, billboards, construction waste) in urban environments using drone-captured images. The system uses deep learning to analyze aerial imagery and identify affected areas.
- **Technologies Used**:  
  Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, CNNs, Jupyter Notebook
- **Results**:  
  Achieved 87% accuracy in classifying polluted vs. non-polluted scenes using transfer learning.
